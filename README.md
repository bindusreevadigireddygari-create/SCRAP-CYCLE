# SCRAP-CYCLE
Waste management continues to be a grave concern in India, with the bulk of recyclable waste being handled by the informal scrap sector. Absence of any credible pricing mechanism, record keeping, and digital communication channels leads to confusion, wrong pricing, and mistrust between users and vendors. Further, emerging technologies-IoT-based smart bins, AI sorting models, and route optimization tools-are of use only in the enhanced collection and do not really help with the transaction between user and scrap vendor, which is the most key part of the entire recycling process.
Scrap Cycle overcomes these gaps in providing a simple and user-friendly online platform to facilitate the sale of scrap material with complete transparency, for a fair price. A rule-based classification algorithm classifies the different scrap items: paper, metal, plastic scraps, and electronic scraps. The system has real-time price mapping, which checks for the current market rate and helps quote a fair value of the scrap to the customer. A weighted price calculation methodology auto-calculates the total amount a user is supposed to receive based on scrap type, quantity, and current rates.
To make the process smooth, Scrap Cycle sends instant e-mail notifications through EmailJS and also records every transaction digitally so that the user and the vendor can have a record of their history. Features like these will help in building trust and eliminating any need for manual calculations or handwritten records. Unlike many complex waste management systems that require heavy hardware or advanced AI, Scrap Cycle is light, affordable, and easy to adopt, thus targeting both urban and semi-urban communities.
Overall, Scrap Cycle brings in the much-needed element of fairness, transparency, and convenience to the scrap-selling process. It will lead to more frequent recycling by masses since it has provided a reliable platform, will definitely contribute towards environmental sustainability through waste reduction, foster a sense of responsible recycling, and align with major global goals such as the United Nations SDGs 11, 12, and 13 relating to responsible consumption, sustainable cities, and climate action, respectively
